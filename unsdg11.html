       Sustainble Development Goal #11 focuses on "Making cities and human settlements includisve, safe, resilient, and sustainable". 
       Currently in the world, there are at least 1 billion people living in the slums. 
       Conditions in these slums are terrible and the picture below shows how terrible these conditions are. 
    <center></p>

    </center></figure>
    <p><center>
        These slums are a big concern for the UN as most of these people do not have access to proper sanitary facilities and live in flimsy houses built on disgusting water.
        The UN plans on working to provide the necessary resources for countries who has big slum problems to be able to build proper housing and give these people much better living conditions.
        The problem of creating sustainable communities is not only in slums and problems such as air pollution is a big concern in major cities. 
        99% of the world's urban population brethe in polluted air. On top of air pollution, globally, only 82% municpal solid waste is collected and only 55% is managed in controlled facilities.
        This means that the remainder of the percentage is not collected and is floating around in our communities where they should not be. 
        These are all examples of the problems that need to be addressed and the UN is proposing targets to be able to meet these problems.

        1. The UN puts emphasis on implmenting effective urban planning and design to create sustainable cities and communitites. 
        This includes incorporating princible of sustainability and longevitiy into urban planning. 
    </center></p>
    <p><center>
        2. Creating affordable slum upgrading. Creating enough afforadable homes is a major target for UNSDG 11 and the 
        UN recognizes that bringing people out of theses slums would be a major step in the right direction.
    </center></p>
    <p><center>
        3. Creating sustainable transportation. The UN believes that enhancing public transportation systems and promoting sustainble options will lower our carbon footpring.
        The UN encourages the development of sustainable transportation options.
    </center></p>
    <p><center>
        4. SDG calls for environmental design to mitigate the environmental impact developemnt has on the environment. This includes accounting for the placement of parks, and planting of trees.
    </center></p>
    <p><center>
        5. Finally, the UN wants developers to consider longevitiy when building, as they want to create sustainable options which will be around for a long time.
    </center></p>
    <h2><center>
        With all of these targets and proposed solutions, it is now up to us and the governments around the world to come together and innovate and implement sustainable options.
